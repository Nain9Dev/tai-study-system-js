# 40 — Tasks

Labels: `[A]` the agent completes it alone · `[M]` mixed, a human action closes it ·
`[H]` human only.

## Done

| Id | Task | Label | Done when |

| T-003 | Rebuild the exam engine: one question at a time, palette, keyboard | `[A]` | ✅ The store's navigation actions are finally used |
| T-004 | Countdown anchored to wall-clock time, with auto-submit | `[A]` | ✅ Exam mode is timed; a background tab cannot gain minutes |
| T-005 | Persist the exam to `sessionStorage` | `[A]` | ✅ A reload mid-exam restores the answer sheet and the clock |
| T-006 | Make the dashboard work for guests and offline | `[A]` | ✅ Local attempts are read, not just written |
| T-007 | Single-flight session rotation with one retry | `[A]` | ✅ An expired token no longer signs the candidate out everywhere |

| T-009 | Align the client with the API contract | `[A]` | ✅ Paginated history, `IntentoRequest` without a grade, `/auth/me` |

| T-011 | Unit tests over marking, aggregation and normalisation | `[A]` | ✅ 48 tests, all green |
| T-013 | Accessibility pass: labels, focus, live regions, reduced motion | `[A]` | ✅ Every control is labelled; no state depends on colour alone |

## Next

| Id | Task | Label | Done when |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| T-012 | Component tests with Testing Library and jsdom | `[A]` | The requirements with no suite in `50-traceability.md` have automated coverage |
| T-014 | End-to-end tests with Playwright | `[A]` | The browser pass recorded in `50-traceability.md` runs on every push |
| T-015 | CI workflow running `npm run verify` | `[M]` | Green on a pull request. Needs the owner to enable Actions |
| T-016 | Service worker so the offline catalogue survives a cold start | `[A]` | The application opens with no network on a first visit |
| T-017 | Route-level code splitting | `[A]` | The initial bundle drops below 250 kB gzipped |
| T-018 | Show the queue's contents, not just its depth | `[A]` | A candidate can see which exams are waiting to sync |

## Session handoff

**State as of 2026-09-08**

- **Done:** the rewrite above. `npm run verify` passes: typecheck, lint, 48 unit tests,
  production build.
- **Verified:** by a browser pass against a live API on a freshly migrated database, not by
  inspection. Full exam flow, persistence, dashboard and mobile layout — recorded in
  `50-traceability.md`. Two bugs surfaced during it and are fixed: the mobile menu icon was
  inverted, and a whitespace-only block selector normalised to an empty string instead of
  the wildcard.
- **Next:** T-012, then T-014.
- **Blocked:** nothing. See [`41-blockers.md`](41-blockers.md).
